In this file we include the libraries needed for our packages.
This info is temporary, when proper Debian packages are created, it will go into them.

* Most of the apps => libdbus-java (D-Bus bindings for Java and Scala)
* File Watcher => python-magic (for guessing MIME types) and python-sunburnt (for Solr, in the libs-as-debs folder) => python-lxml
